# System_Config — Automation Hub

Scheduled jobs and installers that run the workspace. Five launchd agents (clip
ingestion, Friday close-out, Monday note init, health check, skill sync) plus their scripts. All
scripts target macOS `/bin/bash` **3.2** — no bash 4+ features (no associative
arrays). Every scheduled script also runs by hand — the LaunchAgents only ADD the
automatic trigger; manual kickoff always works.

## Relocatable by design

Every script sources `config.sh` first, which derives all paths and the launchd
label namespace from its own location and the environment — **nothing is
hardcoded**. Clone this workspace anywhere and the scripts just work.

| Variable | Derived from | Default |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| `WORKSPACE` | the parent of `System_Config/` (resolved at runtime) | — |
| `VAULT` / `SOURCES` / `LOG_DIR` | `$WORKSPACE` | — |
| `LABEL_PREFIX` | `$AGENT_WS_LABEL_PREFIX`, else `com.$USER.vaultbrain` | `com.<username>.vaultbrain` |
| `CLAUDE` | `command -v agy`, then `gemini`, then `claude`, else fallback | — |

Override the launchd namespace before installing if you want a custom label:

```bash
export AGENT_WS_LABEL_PREFIX="com.acme.vaultbrain"
bash System_Config/install_daily_ingest.sh
```

## Prerequisites (once)

**1. Full Disk Access for `/bin/bash`** — System Settings → Privacy & Security →
Full Disk Access. The `+` picker resists system binaries, so drag it in: Finder
→ ⌘⇧G → `/bin` → drag `bash` onto the list → toggle on. Without it, the scheduled
scripts can't read your `~/Documents` workspace.

**2. launchd log redirects live OUTSIDE the workspace.** Each agent's
`StandardOutPath`/`StandardErrorPath` resolve to `~/Library/Logs/$LABEL_PREFIX/`
(via `LAUNCHD_LOG_DIR` in `config.sh`), not the workspace — and this matters if you
clone into `~/Documents`. launchd opens those redirect files *itself, before*
exec'ing `/bin/bash`, and that open is **not** covered by bash's Full Disk Access, so
a redirect inside `~/Documents` makes the job die at spawn with `EX_CONFIG` (exit 78)
and **no output**, before the script runs. The scripts' own logs still live in
`System_Config/logs/` (written by bash, which has FDA).

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `config.sh` | Shared, relocatable configuration. Sourced first by every other script. Holds the `INGEST_*` ingestion settings (see table below) and the `SCHEDULER` detect (launchd on macOS, cron on Linux, none elsewhere) with `install_cron_job`/`remove_cron_job` helpers the installers use off-Mac. |
| `orchestrator-rules.md` | **Single source** for the rule sections shared by `CLAUDE.md` and `.agents/AGENTS.md`. Edit here, then run `sync_rules.sh`. |
| `sync_rules.sh` | Regenerate the `SHARED:*` marker regions in both orchestrator files from `orchestrator-rules.md`. `--check` exits 1 on drift (wired for CI/healthcheck use). |
| `run_agent.sh` | Sourced library: `run_agent <prompt>` — the single provider-branch (claude/gemini flags + watchdog) shared by `daily_ingest.sh` and `friday_process.sh`. Watchdog sends TERM, then KILL 20s later (a wedged CLI can't hang the job). Flag changes happen here once. |
| `deps.sh` | Recorded tested versions of the external CLIs; `./bootstrap.sh --check` prints an informational drift line when installed versions differ. |
| `test.sh` | Template self-test: `bash -n` + `shellcheck --severity=error` over every script, rules-drift check, schema check, `py_compile` on the Python (hook + `gen_site.py`), and JSON validation of `.claude/settings.json` / `.mcp.json.example`. Run locally anytime; CI runs it on every push (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). |
| `migrate_vault.sh` | Vault schema migration runner (`Vault_Brain/.vault-schema` marker, TARGET_SCHEMA constant). No-ops when current; errors if the vault is newer than the template. |
| `new_agent.sh` | Scaffold a new agent in BOTH harness formats (`.claude/agents/` + `.agents/skills/`). Dry-run by default; `--write` creates. Register in `.AGENT.MD` afterwards. |
| `export_workspace.sh` / `import_workspace.sh` | Portable tar.gz of the vault + projects + agent configs (secrets/logs/git excluded); import refuses non-empty targets. Anti-lock-in escape hatch. |
| `vault_snapshot.sh` | Daily git snapshot of `Vault_Brain/` only (skips if the index has staged changes; push failure is non-fatal). |
| `vaultsnapshot.plist.tmpl` | launchd agent template: snapshot daily one hour after ingest (INGEST_HOUR+1, :15). |
| `install_vault_snapshot.sh` | Render + install/reload the snapshot agent (idempotent). |
| `daily_ingest.sh` | Ingest new `.md` notes from each dir in `INGEST_SOURCES` (default `sources:Raw_Notes`, vault-relative) into the wiki, one headless `agy -p` or `claude -p` call per note. Content-hash dedup via a per-dir `<dir>/.ingested.log` manifest (`<sha256>\t<filename>`). Warns when unscanned `.md` files sit in subfolders. Concurrency lock (`logs/daily_ingest.lock`) skips overlapping runs; a clip that fails/no-ops 3 times is quarantined via `<dir>/.failed.log` (delete its line to retry). |
| `dailyingest.plist.tmpl` | launchd agent template: runs ingest daily at `INGEST_HOUR:INGEST_MINUTE` (default 07:00) + at login. Rendered into `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` by the installer. |
| `install_daily_ingest.sh` | Render + install/reload the ingest agent (idempotent). |
| `friday_process.sh` | Friday 16:30 weekly close-out: Claude writes a 1–2 sentence summary + append-only wiki cross-refs, deterministic bash edits the Master Note row (backup + validate + rollback), and a `.<week>.fridayclose.snapshot.md` baseline is saved (used Monday to detect weekend edits). |
| `fridayprocess.plist.tmpl` | launchd agent template: runs the close-out Fridays at 16:30. |
| `install_friday_process.sh` | Render + install/reload the Friday agent (idempotent). |
| `healthcheck.sh` | Probe all architecture layers (A–I) + doc currency → `status_page.html` + `status.json` (here), publish `docs/status.js` + `docs/status.json` for `docs/health.html`, **and** push the snapshot to `origin/main` (via a detached worktree) so the live Pages dashboard auto-updates. Layer E also warns when the `## Active Projects` table drifts from `Projects/`; Layer I surfaces pending + quarantined clips. Always exits 0; never reports green on a broken system. |
| `healthcheck.plist.tmpl` | launchd agent template: runs the health check at login + every 4 hours. |
| `install_healthcheck.sh` | Render + install/reload the health-check agent (idempotent). |
| `monday_init.sh` | Create the current ISO-week note from the template. Carries open tasks forward **grouped under their `#### Project` header** (with sub-bullets), and **merges weekend edits** to last week's note into the new one. Runs at login + Mon 08:00 via launchd, or by hand. |
| `mondayinit.plist.tmpl` | launchd agent template: runs `monday_init.sh` at login/startup + Mondays 08:00. |
| `install_monday_init.sh` | Render + install/reload the Monday agent (idempotent). |
| `sync-skills.sh` | Sync skills installed via `npx skills add -g` from `~/.agents/skills/` into `~/.claude/skills/` (Claude Code's actual read path), then flag any unindexed skills in `master-orchestrator`. |
| `syncskills.plist.tmpl` | launchd agent template: fires via WatchPaths on `~/.agents/skills` + hourly + at login. Rendered into `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` by the installer. |
| `install_sync_skills.sh` | Render + install/reload the skill-sync agent (idempotent). |
| `friday_archive.sh` | Archive the week's note (manual / `cron 0 18 * * 5`). |
| `obsidian-webclipper-template.json` | Obsidian Web Clipper template → writes clips to the vault's `sources/` folder with frontmatter (filename via `{{title\|safe_name}}`). |
| `logs/` | Per-job **script** logs (`daily_ingest.log`, `healthcheck.log`, …) in the workspace. The launchd `.out`/`.err` redirects live in `~/Library/Logs/$LABEL_PREFIX/` (see Prerequisites). |

### Ingestion configuration (`config.sh`)

Set by `bootstrap.sh` during setup; edit `config.sh` anytime (re-run
`install_daily_ingest.sh` after changing the schedule so the plist re-renders).
All are env-overridable per run.

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `INGEST_SOURCES` | `sources:Raw_Notes` | Colon-separated dirs (relative to `Vault_Brain/`) scanned for new `.md` notes. Each keeps its own `.ingested.log`. |
| `INGEST_PROVIDER` | `auto` | `auto` (PATH detection: agy → gemini → claude), or force `claude` / `gemini`. |
| `INGEST_HOUR` / `INGEST_MINUTE` | `7` / `0` | Daily launchd schedule, rendered into the plist on install. |
| `INGEST_MAX_BUDGET` | `1.00` | Per-clip USD ceiling — claude only (gemini has no cost flag). |
| `INGEST_MAX_SECONDS` | `900` | Per-clip wall-clock watchdog — both providers. |

> **Generated at runtime, not shipped:** `healthcheck.sh` writes
> `status_page.html` and `status.json` into this directory each time it runs.
> They are not part of the template — run the health check to create them.
>
> **Auto-updates the live Pages site (no working-tree churn):** the dashboard is
> published as `docs/status.js` (a `window.__STATUS__` assignment) + `docs/status.json`,
> which `docs/health.html` reads via a `<script>` tag (not `fetch`). To keep the
> *published* dashboard fresh without manual commits, each run writes + commits those
> two files **only inside a detached worktree pinned to `origin/main`** (Pages' source)
> at `~/Library/Caches/agent-workspace-health-publish`, then pushes. The job's own
> checkout is never written to — so it no longer leaves `docs/status.*` perpetually
> dirty. Best-effort: a git/auth failure is logged to `logs/healthcheck.log` and the
> run still exits 0. For a fresh **local** view, open `status_page.html` here.

## Installed plist names

The installers render each `*.plist.tmpl` into
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/<LABEL>.plist`, where `<LABEL>` is built from
`$LABEL_PREFIX`:

- `com.<username>.vaultbrain.dailyingest.plist`
- `com.<username>.vaultbrain.fridayprocess.plist`
- `com.<username>.vaultbrain.mondayinit.plist`
- `com.<username>.vaultbrain.healthcheck.plist`

(`<username>` defaults to your `$USER`; override with `$AGENT_WS_LABEL_PREFIX`.)

## Common commands

All commands are relative to the workspace root.

# Verify a scheduled agent (col 2 = last exit status; 0 = healthy)
launchctl list | grep vaultbrain
```

## Conventions

- **Auth:** headless `claude` uses the login keychain (unlocked while logged in).
  Optional fallback for detached runs: `~/.config/anthropic/key` (mode 0600).
- **Ingest safety:** shell denied, cwd confined to the vault, clip files locked
  read-only during a run, per-clip budget + wall-clock caps, create-or-append only.
- **Doc currency:** the health check's *Documentation Currency* section flags any
  README older than the files it documents. When you change a script or schema,
  update the governing README in the same task (see root `CLAUDE.md` →
  *Documentation Integrity*).
